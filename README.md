## Hi there üëã

I'm an Electrical Engineering student at TU Vienna, specializing in automation and robotics.
At heart, I'm a software developer with a passion for writing robust code.
Rust is my language of choice but if need be I can code in any language.
I love to contribute to open source projects, I pass by or use myself.

### üöÄ Serious Projects

- [no_std_io_rs](https://github.com/raldone01/no_std_io_rs) - A library that provides a no_std compatible implementation of streaming infrastructure similar to `std::io` and a filesystem abstraction layer for Rust. It includes a streaming tar archive reader/writer with hardened parsing for large or malicious files.
- [image-date-fixer](https://github.com/raldone01/image-date-fixer) - A Rust CLI tool that can fix the EXIF date of images based on their filename or filesystem metadata. This is useful for fixing images that had their EXIF data stripped or were taken with devices that don't set the EXIF date correctly.
